# Menu-Up
User fueled system for rating menu items at restaurants.

This is a personal project, but I give credit to Karen Xiao for coming up with the idea.

This project's end goal is to publish an app on the iPhone store that provides users with a platform to rate menu item's at restaurants. The secondary goals include having cross-platform capabilities with android devices, as well as having a website.

Seeing as the scope of these goals are very large for one single individual, I do not expect to ever truly finish this project. That being said, I plan to use this project as a way to test and improve my development skills. 


# Project Description
The Menu-Up system allows users to take pictures of dishes served to them at a restaurant, and then rate and comment on those dishes. Users can then view restaurants menu's on the website, view what the dishes actually look like based off of other people's pictures, and view other people's comments on the dishes and the average rating.


# Moderation
There should be some form of moderation. Perhaps peer-reviews, or specifically hired individuals whom are willing to check data. 

Another option is to allow restaurant owners or PR to moderate pictures applied to their restaurants menu dishes. A safeguard that should be included with this method is to not allow the restaurant owners to see the comment or the rating, only the picture being submitted. That way, if the comment is a bad one, there will be less of a bias. 

Another option is to set up a flagging system, where if a picture gets flagged a certain amount of times, it will either enter the needs-to-be-checked folder, so someone could check it, or there could be a limit to amount of flags based on viewership of the post.

There should also be some form of system in place that will do some of the work of checking submitted pictures. Porn should not be allowed to be posted on the site, and this could be dissuaded by using one of those picture checker systems that try to associate pictures with what they are by matching pictures against a database of many pictures. 

Also, comments should be controlled to not have any racial or stereotyped slang. Fuck and shit should be allowed, but not ni**** or fa****.


# User Incentive
Unknown so far.


# Database of Restaurants
I may try to use Yelp's API to get some data going at the beginning.
